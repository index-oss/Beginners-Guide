## 📘 About the Book
**Rules of Coding** is an open-source digital book that teaches the *art and discipline* of programming.  
It combines **technical learning** (GitHub, commits, documentation) with **real coding wisdom** — the habits, rules, and philosophies that build great coders.

Anyone can read it freely, contribute, and help evolve it — because good code grows when it’s shared.
